          - paragraph [ref=e68]: I took some Salvia last night, it’s illegal in my state so idk if it was legit or not. But I basically just turned into a tree except my perception of time was weird. There was no day or night just kind of this in between state, and I think I might have been there for 100 years or something. But the time perception was weird so it didn’t feel like a hundred years, it felt like closer to maybe 5 years. But I started as a seed that fell to the ground and I rooted myself in the ground and start growing, my roots felt like tentacles moving around in the ground looking for water and nutrients constantly, and I could consciously move them around. Eventually I started to feel this growing “aching” pain and started losing control of different roots and branches and then I just opened my eyes and I was in my garage again

          - paragraph [ref=e87]: A friend showed me this video a few days ago while we were at the same spot on the coast in Scopello, Sicily. It was shown to her two years ago by a traveller she had met at the same location. The light immediately makes me think it’s a person diving at night with a torch, but the serpent shaped body and what seems like a spine along the back makes me question everything. What the hell is this?

            - paragraph [ref=e144]: I’ve been reading up on panpsychism and was curious, could the combination problem be partly explained by the protoconscious reacting electromagneticly with the structured EM waves of the brain? So the brain acts as a sort of receiver and amplifier for the omnipresent protoconscious shifting more from fusion of small minds to big mind, to more of a resonant organization?
            - paragraph [ref=e145]: Any thoughts on this? Agree or disagree, directed to more reading is always appreciated.
