          - paragraph [ref=e86]: I took some Salvia last night, it’s illegal in my state so idk if it was legit or not. But I basically just turned into a tree except my perception of time was weird. There was no day or night just kind of this in between state, and I think I might have been there for 100 years or something. But the time perception was weird so it didn’t feel like a hundred years, it felt like closer to maybe 5 years. But I started as a seed that fell to the ground and I rooted myself in the ground and start growing, my roots felt like tentacles moving around in the ground looking for water and nutrients constantly, and I could consciously move them around. Eventually I started to feel this growing “aching” pain and started losing control of different roots and branches and then I just opened my eyes and I was in my garage again

          - paragraph [ref=e105]: A friend showed me this video a few days ago while we were at the same spot on the coast in Scopello, Sicily. It was shown to her two years ago by a traveller she had met at the same location. The light immediately makes me think it’s a person diving at night with a torch, but the serpent shaped body and what seems like a spine along the back makes me question everything. What the hell is this?
