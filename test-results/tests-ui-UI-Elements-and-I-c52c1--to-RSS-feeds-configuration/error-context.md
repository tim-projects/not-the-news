          - paragraph [ref=e86]: I took some Salvia last night, it’s illegal in my state so idk if it was legit or not. But I basically just turned into a tree except my perception of time was weird. There was no day or night just kind of this in between state, and I think I might have been there for 100 years or something. But the time perception was weird so it didn’t feel like a hundred years, it felt like closer to maybe 5 years. But I started as a seed that fell to the ground and I rooted myself in the ground and start growing, my roots felt like tentacles moving around in the ground looking for water and nutrients constantly, and I could consciously move them around. Eventually I started to feel this growing “aching” pain and started losing control of different roots and branches and then I just opened my eyes and I was in my garage again

          - paragraph [ref=e105]: A friend showed me this video a few days ago while we were at the same spot on the coast in Scopello, Sicily. It was shown to her two years ago by a traveller she had met at the same location. The light immediately makes me think it’s a person diving at night with a torch, but the serpent shaped body and what seems like a spine along the back makes me question everything. What the hell is this?

          - generic [ref=e159]:
            - paragraph [ref=e160]: After years of watching YouTube videos about startup / founder stuff and reading blogs, Reddit, and the horrible place that is LinkedIn, I came to realize that 99.9% of advice (especially in the SaaS world) is written / recorded by people who fake their success and their content IS their only real product.
            - paragraph [ref=e161]: There are a few exceptions, but mostly it's all fake.
            - paragraph [ref=e162]: Even worse, startup advice has become an industry praying on the insecurities and vulnerability of first time founders. It is just as ridiculously bloated as the parenting literature, full of pseudo-sciency snakeoil sales men and women selling their "system", "secrets" and "hard earned truths".
            - paragraph [ref=e163]: "Just like the only parenting book you'll ever need is one page long (and it literally reads: \"if you want to be a good parent work on unconditional love and your patience.\"), the only startup book you'd ever need fits on a napkin. It would read:"
            - list [ref=e164]:
              - listitem [ref=e165]: validate your ideas w real users as soon as possible
              - listitem [ref=e166]: always gather feedback from your users and build it in iteratively, shipping fast
              - listitem [ref=e167]: don't think about scaling until you really need to, so use boring tech, boring GTM and just do the f*ing work instead of trying to optimize/game the system
              - listitem [ref=e168]: selling and marketing IS the hard part not building
              - listitem [ref=e169]: there's no shortcut or hacks just consistent work
              - listitem [ref=e170]: hire your first 5 employees as if you were selecting your spouse and be just as good to them as you'd to your family
              - listitem [ref=e171]: whatever you achieve, you got lucky so don't get cocky. Learn from it and try to replicate it in your next one.
            - paragraph [ref=e172]: That's it. That's all there is to it basically.
            - paragraph [ref=e173]: But obviously, just as with the parenting literature, no one can admit that otherwise there would be no best selling authors and YouTube channels with millions of subs. There would be no industry around the pornificaton of entrepreneur-secrets.
            - paragraph [ref=e174]: This brings me to my final point. If 99.9% who posts on Reddit and makes videos on YouTube are just actors selling you a dream, where are the truly successful entrepreneurs? They are sure as f*ck not posting on LinkedIn about their routine or system or whatever. And I'd bet my balls they are not here in the comment section either, dishing out advice. So where are they?
            - paragraph [ref=e175]: Well, you guessed it. They are doing the work and running their companies.
            - paragraph [ref=e176]: Kinda make sense, doesn't it.
            - paragraph [ref=e177]: "Disclaimer: by my own definition I'm a nobody too that's why I'm here. But since I realized the above I spend way less time in the founder/saas/startup YouTube and blogosphere wasting my time. Hopefully it'll be useful to others just starting out, grinding through their first year or so."
            - paragraph [ref=e178]: "Full disclosure bc someone asked this in the comments: we are working on automating the first point of the 7 above, check my profile or the comments if you're interested. (Hopefully it's clear I didn't post bc of this, it just came up in the discussion)."
