The UI issue persists: text fields in the settings modal        briefly show content then disappear. My debugging so far        involved adding console.logs to uiElements.js and               uiInitializers.js to track textarea availability and            content, and partially updating tests/config.spec.js to use     page.waitForFunction for the RSS Feeds textarea.                                                                                Remaining tasks:                                                 1. Complete Playwright Test Update: Apply                          page.waitForFunction to the Keyword Blacklist textarea          in tests/config.spec.js. I need to ensure the                   old_string is accurate for the replacement.                  2. Analyze New Playwright Logs: Examine the console                output from the updated Playwright tests to pinpoint            when getTextarea() returns null and verify content              before assignment.                                           3. Investigate Alpine.js: If logs show correct data but            the UI fails, I'll delve into Alpine.js's x-show and            x-model directives, potentially using x-init,                   x-effect, or direct DOM manipulation as workarounds.                                                                        My next step is to fix the tests/config.spec.js replacement      for the Keyword Blacklist.
