# TODO
- fix the device restore state syncing
- seperate merge_feeds, into fetch_feeds.py and merge_feeds.py with one just getting feeds, and the other handling combining them
- cache feeds in /data/feed/cache, and make it so that new feeds are only downloaded if there is a change.
- add a source to the top right of each item
- fix the close animation
