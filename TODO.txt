# TODO
- fix the close animation
- get images showing
- add stars to items and the drop down display filter
- replace scroll to top icon with an svg (like the cog wheel)
- add a password setting and screen, to block bots and scrapers.
- restore light mode theme to like in the screenshot
- migrate from localstorage to indexedDB
- create xml2json.py and change the api to serve from feed.json using unique item hashes

# LATER
- implement a hidden status bar and flash a toast message if something went wrong saving the state, or when syncing
- seperate merge_feeds, into fetch_feeds.py and merge_feeds.py with one just getting feeds, and the other handling combining them
- cache feeds in /data/feed/download-cache, and make it in fetch_feeds.py so that new feeds are only downloaded if there is a change.
- have filtered_feed create a hidden.xml and unread.xml and saved.xml and only load those when selected using js to save on bandwidth
- rework styles.css and turn all the sizing into relative variables.
- make the python and js files read only, and run caddy as none root

  then write a function in js to download the entire list, re-combine them save offline to localstorage and display. The idea is all the xml files will be cached in localstorage except the newest one, so less data is used when syncing. Also enables offline reading.
- turn app into a PWA app
