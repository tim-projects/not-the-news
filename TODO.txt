# TODO
- fix the wrong url on reddit/wired titles
- on settings screen, set the autosync toggle to partial sync and add a force sync button.
- implement a hidden pop up bar and flash a toast message when syncing, if something went wrong saving the state, or when syncing/internet disconnected. This should cover the top header while it's active, and hide after 1 second of inactivity.


# LATER
- Add a custom theme styling box in the settings.

- Keyword whitelist. 
This is a list of keywords that override your blacklist. This feature can be used to ensure that if you do need to catch current or timely events that you have a way to do so.

for example. Adding a keyword set of 'breaking, war' will promote to the top any items that contain both these keywords.
- if reddit description contains [link], if it's an i.reddit.it image, rewrite the link as an img tag, if it's v.reddit.it rewrite the link as a video tag, otherwise set the <link> tag to it. Hide the [link]

- AI based feed tastemaking
Ambitious idea to build an algo that auto finds new rss feeds based on the users app interactions

```
Hereâ€™s the **fully updated design prompt** with all the enhancements weâ€™ve discussed:

---

# âœ… Personalized Feed Ranking & News Control

*(for app: **Not The News**)*

---

## **Core Concept**

A vertical feed app serving **10-card decks**.
Each item = an enriched RSS entry with:

* **Category** (Tier 1)
* **Subcategory** (Tier 2)
* **Timeliness Tag** (Tier 3: `breaking`, `recent`, `evergreen`)
* **Hash** (for fast relevance scoring)

User interactions:

* Scroll, Star, Hide, Click, Shuffle, Clear Deck.

Goal:

* Personalize feed for **long-term interests**, **balanced variety**, **controlled timeliness**.
* Avoid addiction loops & doomscrolling.
* Allow news for engagement but prevent full takeover.

---

## âœ… **Event Logging**

Minimal but rich logs:

```json
{
  "event": "enter" | "exit" | "star" | "hide" | "click" | "shuffle" | "clear_deck",
  "cardId": "uuid",
  "deckId": "uuid",
  "timestamp": 1721209824,
  "meta": {
    "direction": "up" | "down",  
    "gesture": "drag" | "flick"  
  }
}
```

---

## âœ… **Content Enrichment (Server-Side)**

Each RSS item â†’ enriched with:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "...",
  "url": "...",
  "category": "Technology",
  "subcategory": "AI",
  "timeliness": "breaking", // breaking, recent, evergreen
  "hash": "hash_of_keywords",
  "media": {"images": 1, "videos": 0, "audio": 0}
}
```

### Category & Subcategory Extraction

* Use **keyword siloing** + **LLM API** (Gemini Flash or similar) for classification.
* Hash generated from normalized keyword set.

---

## âœ… **User Profile**

```json
{
  "keywords": [
    {"term": "AI", "long_term": 12.0, "short_term": 3.0},
    {"term": "blockchain", "long_term": -7.0, "short_term": -1.5}
  ],
  "media_prefs": {
    "images": 5.3,
    "videos": 8.2,
    "audio": -2.1,
    "text_only": 1.0
  },
  "meta": {
    "shuffles_today": 3,
    "decks_cleared_today": 2,
    "timeliness_factor": 1.0,
    "engagement_score": 0.82
  }
}
```

---

## âœ… **Three-Tier Interest Model**

* **Tier 1:** Category (stable identity)
* **Tier 2:** Subcategory (granular context)
* **Tier 3:** Timeliness Tag

  * `breaking` (+15), `recent` (+5), `evergreen` (0)
  * Aggressive decay:
    Breaking â†’ half-life = 30 min
    Recent â†’ half-life = 6â€“12h

Combined weight:

```
final_weight(term) = (long_term * 0.7) + (short_term * 1.3)
```

---

## âœ… **Signals & Behavior Scoring**

```
Star: +20
Click: +10
Dwell >5s: +5
Dwell 1â€“5s: +1
<1s: -5
Hide fast (<1s): -15
Flick away: -10
Clear after reading: +10
Shuffle spam: penalty (anti-addiction)
```

---

## âœ… **News Saturation Penalty**

* Track news ratio:

```
news_ratio = news_engagements / total_engagements
```

* If `news_ratio > 0.3`:

```
penalty = (news_ratio - 0.3) * Î²
adjusted_score = score - penalty
```

---

## âœ… **Deck Diversity Rules**

* Max **3 news items** per 10-card deck (normal mode).
* Always mix evergreen or interest-based cards.

---

## âœ… **Re-engagement Mode**

If engagement drops below 70% of baseline:

* Activate:

  * `timeliness_boost_factor = 1.5â€“2.0`
  * Max news per deck = 5
  * Halve saturation penalty.
* Deactivate gradually over 3â€“5 decks.

---

## âœ… **Trigger Category Control**

* Track "trigger\_score" for rage-bait categories.
* If too high:

```
adjusted_category_score = category_score * (1 - trigger_penalty)
```

---

## âœ… **Ranking Formula**

```
final_score =
    behavior_score
  + (keyword_score * 1.0)
  + media_score
  + (timeliness_score * user_timeliness_factor * timeliness_boost_factor)
  - saturation_penalty
```

---

## âœ… **Retention Rules**

* Long-term decay: 0.99 per cycle (never zero).
* Short-term decay: 0.9 per cycle.
* Maintain baseline profile for stability.

---

## âœ… **Pipeline Summary**

1. Aggregate & clean RSS feeds.
2. Enrich items:

   * Category, subcategory, timeliness, hash.
3. Rank on **server** using profile + rules.
4. Push **pre-ranked pool** to client.
5. Client picks 10-card decks (light shuffle allowed).

---

### âœ… **Optional Hash Optimization**

* Hash = minhash or simhash of keywords â†’ enables fast similarity checks.
* Profile still keeps **\~150 keywords** for fine-grain personalization.

---

ðŸ”¥ This design ensures:

* Personalized content.
* Controlled timeliness influence.
* Anti-addiction + diversity bias.
* Engagement recovery without spam.
* Server does heavy lifting â†’ client lightweight.
