# TODO
- fix the wrong url on reddit/wired titles
- on settings screen, set the autosync toggle to partial sync and add a force sync button.
- implement a hidden pop up bar and flash a toast message when syncing, if something went wrong saving the state, or when syncing/internet disconnected. This should cover the top header while it's active, and hide after 1 second of inactivity.


# LATER
- Add a custom theme styling box in the settings.

- Keyword whitelist. 
This is a list of keywords that override your blacklist. This feature can be used to ensure that if you do need to catch current or timely events that you have a way to do so.

for example. Adding a keyword set of 'breaking, war' will promote to the top any items that contain both these keywords.
- if reddit description contains [link], if it's an i.reddit.it image, rewrite the link as an img tag, if it's v.reddit.it rewrite the link as a video tag, otherwise set the <link> tag to it. Hide the [link]

- AI based feed tastemaking
Ambitious idea to build an algo that auto finds new rss feeds based on the users app interactions
